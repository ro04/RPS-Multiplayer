Instructions:

Create a game that suits this user story:

Only two users can play at the same time.

Both players pick either rock, paper or scissors. After the players make their selection, the game will tell them whether a tie occurred or if one player defeated the other.

The game will track each player's wins and losses.

Throw some chat functionality in there! No online multiplayer game is complete without having to endure endless taunts and insults from your jerk opponent.

Styling and theme are completely up to you. Get Creative!


Things to do:
1. Only the last player to pick can see who won. Make it so both players will be able to see who won at the same time.

2. Hide links after player picks, display links after round has ended. 

3. Disconnect function is not working properly. When one player disconnects, both are removed from the database.

4. Work on the layout. Make it mobile friendly. Add color, etc. 

5. Set a timer for players to make a pick.
